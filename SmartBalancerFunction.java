/*
Here is an example of an Apache Pulsar Function in Java that uses machine learning to route messages for smart balancing:

This function receives a message as input and uses a machine learning model to determine the appropriate destination for the message. The function then sends the message to the destination and returns null to indicate that it does not produce any output.

In the setup() method, the function loads the machine learning model that will be used to route messages. In the cleanup() method, the function closes the model and releases any resources it was using.

Note: This is just an example, and the specific implementation of the machine learning model and how it is used to route messages will depend on your specific use case.
