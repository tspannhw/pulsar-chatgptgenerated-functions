/**
Here is a basic template for an Apache Pulsar Function in Java:

This template defines a MyFunction class that implements the Function interface from the org.apache.pulsar.functions.api package. The Function interface requires that the process method be implemented, which takes an input of type String and returns an output of type String. You can modify the input and output types as needed for your specific use case.

The process method also takes a Context object as a parameter, which provides information about the execution environment and allows you to interact with the Pulsar Function runtime.

You can use this template as a starting point for implementing your own Apache Pulsar Function in Java. Be sure to import any necessary dependencies and add your own custom code in the process method to define the functionality of your function.

import org.apache.pulsar.functions.api.Context;
import org.apache.pulsar.functions.api.Function;

public class MyFunction implements Function<String, String> {
  @Override
  public String process(String input, Context context) {
    // Your code here
  }
}
