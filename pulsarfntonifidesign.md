**Connect Apache Pulsar Functions to Apache NiFi **asynchronously in a way that will scale to 1,000,000 messages per second.

To connect Apache Pulsar Functions to Apache NiFi asynchronously, you can use the Pulsar Function Runner to run your Pulsar Functions and then use the NiFi ConsumePulsar or ConsumePulsarFunctions processor to read messages from the Pulsar topic. This will allow you to scale to high throughputs, as both Pulsar and NiFi are designed for high performance and scalability.

Here are the general steps you would need to follow:

Install and configure Apache Pulsar and Apache NiFi on your cluster.

Create a Pulsar Function that processes the messages in the way you want.

Use the Pulsar Function Runner to run your Pulsar Function and connect it to the Pulsar topic where the messages are published.

In Apache NiFi, use the ConsumePulsar or ConsumePulsarFunctions processor to read messages from the Pulsar topic and process them as needed.

Configure the processor settings, such as the number of concurrent threads and the maximum number of messages to process per second, to achieve the desired level of performance and scalability.

Monitor the performance of your NiFi flow and adjust the settings as needed to ensure that it can handle the desired throughput of 1,000,000 messages per second.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
