/*
To write an Apache Pulsar Function in Java that encodes incoming strings as URLs, you can use the PulsarFunction interface provided by the Pulsar Function API. This interface defines a single method, process, that takes in a PulsarMessage object and returns a PulsarMessage object.

Here is an example implementation of the process method that encodes incoming strings as URLs:

In this example, the process method receives a PulsarMessage object that contains a string in its value field. It uses the URLEncoder class from the Java Standard Library to encode the string as a URL, and returns the encoded string as the output of the function.

Note that this example uses the URLEncoder class from the Java Standard Library, but other libraries, such as the Apache Commons Codec library, could also be used to encode URLs. The choice of library will depend on your specific requirements and preferences.

*/

public class URLEncodeFunction implements PulsarFunction<String, String> {
  @Override
  public String process(PulsarMessage<String> input) {
    // Encode the input string as a URL
    String encoded = URLEncoder.encode(input.getValue(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

    // Return the encoded string as the output of the function
    return encoded;
  }
}
