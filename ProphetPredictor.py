# Here is an example of how you could create an Apache Pulsar Function in Python that utilizes the Facebook Prophet library to make time series predictions:

from typing import List

import pandas as pd
from fbprophet import Prophet
from pulsar import Function


class ProphetPredictor(Function):
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = Prophet()

    def process(self, event, context):
        # Parse the event data into a Pandas DataFrame
        event_data = pd.DataFrame(event, columns=["timestamp", "value"])

        # Fit the Prophet model on the event data
        self.model.fit(event_data)

        # Use the Prophet model to make predictions on the next 10 timestamps
        future = self.model.make_future_dataframe(periods=10, freq="H")
        predictions = self.model.predict(future)

        # Return the predicted values as a list of tuples
        return [(predictions.loc[i, "timestamp"], predictions.loc[i, "yhat"]) for i in range(len(predictions))]

      
# In this example, the ProphetPredictor class extends the Function class from the Apache Pulsar Python client library, and uses the process method to implement the logic for making time series predictions using the Prophet library. The process method takes in an event and a context, both of which are provided by Pulsar. The event data is expected to be a list of tuples containing timestamps and corresponding values, which are used to train the Prophet model. The process method then uses the trained model to make predictions on the next 10 timestamps, and returns the predicted values as a list of tuples.
# To use this function in Pulsar, you would first need to create a Pulsar topic that contains the event data you want to make predictions on. You can then use the Pulsar Python client library to create a FunctionConfig object that specifies the class name of your function (ProphetPredictor in this case), as well as any other configuration options that you want to set. Finally, you can use the Functions class to submit your function to Pulsar, which will take care of running the function and making it available to process events from the specified topic.
# Here is an example of how you could do this:
  
from pulsar import Client, FunctionConfig
from pulsar.functions import Functions

# Create a Pulsar client and use it to create a FunctionConfig object
client = Client("pulsar://localhost:6650")
function_config = FunctionConfig()
function_config.set_class_name("ProphetPredictor")

# Submit the function to Pulsar
functions = Functions(client)
functions.create_function("my-function-name", function_config)

#
# Once your function has been submitted to Pulsar, it will be automatically triggered whenever new events are published to the specified topic, and will use the Prophet library to make predictions on the event data. You can then use the Pulsar Python client library to consume the predicted values from a separate topic, or you can use one of the Pulsar REST APIs to retrieve the predicted values directly.

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
